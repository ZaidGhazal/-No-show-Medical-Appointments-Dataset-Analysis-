# No-show Medical Appointments Dataset Analysis

The notebook (Source_code) presents the investigation process on the "No-show appointments" dataset. briefly, the dataset contains 110527 confirmed medical appointments in Brazil and it shows some information about each patient like (age, diabetes status, Alcoholism status, gender, appointment day, and so on...). In addition, it tells us whether the patient missed the appointment or not. In the project, python is used to analyze the dataset with Pandas, Matplotlib and NumPy packages.

There are several questions I tried to answer during the analysis:

- The proportion of missed/attended appointments over the total appointments number
- How did having the scholarship (Brasilian welfare program) affect the attendance ratio?
- How did receiving reminder SMS affect the attendance ratio?
- How does age affect the risk of having diabetes?
- For the neighbourhoods with 100 or more appointments registered, what is/are the neighborhood(s) with the highest/lowest appointment missing proportion?

And more can be investigated!
